# Anti-Sleep-Glasses
Anti-sleeping glasses are designed to prevent drowsiness by using sensors that detect signs of fatigue, such as head nodding or blinking patterns. When these signs are detected, the glasses trigger an alert, such as vibrations or sounds, to wake the user and enhance alertness, particularly for drivers or machine operators.
